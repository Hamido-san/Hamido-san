🖐 Heya, I'm @Hamido-san

I started programming at age 16 and have since lived both as a starry-eyed freelancer and a jaded corporate zombie, but I still can't get enough of it

I'm currently learning [Clojure](https://clojure.org/): It's the answer to all my prayers and I want to code with it as both job & hobby
