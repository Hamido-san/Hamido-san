üñê Heya, I'm @Hamido-san

I started programming at age 16 and have since lived both as a starry-eyed freelancer and a jaded corporate zombie, but I still can't get enough of it

- I've done a bunch of `C++Builder` in college [and **liked** it]
- Then switched to `Visual Basic` for work [and **hated** it]
- Then switched to `C#` to keep sane [and **liked** it a lot]
- Then learend a bit of `Swift` [which was **pretty cool** but **useless** in Windows]
- Then tried my hand at client-side `VueJs` [and **liked** it, but I really **hate** `JS`]
- I also dabbled in `php` [which I didn't even finish learning 'cuz... **yuck!**]
- Then tried some `Python` [but still fail to see the point of its popularity]
- And just when I was about to try `Go`...
- [Uncle Bob Martin insisted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2yr-3F6PQo) I look at `Clojure` [let's just call it **love-at-first-sight**, OK?]

I'm currently learning [Clojure](https://clojure.org/): It's the answer to all my prayers and I want to code with it as both job & hobby... please?
